# NKAZE SOCIAL MEDIA APP

## Motivation

Nkaze social is fully responsive social media app writen with React Js, Material Ui and Redux Toolkit.

This project was motivated by my desire to keep myself busy and keep practicing so I don't lose my skills with time. 

I originally wanted to use this for a short season fun but ended up looking towards a fully fleshed social medial app with Authentication, Live messaging, engaging ui components, single paged, async designed and most importantly fast(Though my current hosting slows it down). 

This will repository will serve as the front ent for the complete social media app
